**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

From the standpoint of data security, we should not have been able to easily insert a new record into the customer_purchases database, since doing so could inflate the sales that the vendors actually generate from the farmer's market. This ties into the appropriate access to data peice, where individuals who might have conflict of interest should not be given access to data that could potentially give them an unfair advantage. For example, a vendor should not have access to vendor_inventory table since it contains the prices of all products that his/her competitors sell. Having access to this information could allow the vendor to price cut his/her competitor.
From the privacy perspective, customer and zip_data table combined contains information about a customer's full name and household income.This is very sensitive and private data of which should only be shared if consented by the individual.
