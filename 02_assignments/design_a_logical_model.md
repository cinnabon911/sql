# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. 📚

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Type 1 is a method where new data gets overwritten with old data, and therefore does not track historical data. If we adopt Type 1 method, we won't be able to retrieve a customer's previous adresses once the customer provides a new address. A table design consistent with Type 1 is as follows

[CustomerAddress]
CustomerID (Foreign Key)
Address
City
State
ZipCode
Country

 Type 2 is a method used to track historical data, where a new row is inserted into the table for each customer's new address.

[CustomerAddress]
AddressID (Primary Key)
CustomerID (Foreign Key)
Address
City
State
ZipCode
Country
StartDate
EndDate (nullable, null if the address is current)

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
1. The AdventureWorks ERD has different schemas that are designed around real world entity (departments), e.g. sales, human resources
2. There is a rowguid field in certain tables in AdventureWorks, i.e. SalesPerson, SalesTaxRate, which serves as the unique identifier

For my customer table, I would add fields - modified date and account number - that are used in the AdventureWorks table. Reason being customers' deatils could change, e.g. phone number, address, so modified date helps us identify the time these changes are made. Account number is realistic in today's world since most shops have an e commerce website that requires the customers to make an account.
